# MIPS Processor

This project implements a MIPS processor using VHDL. The processor was designed for educational purposes, developed for a computer architecture class.

## Project Description

The MIPS processor developed in this project implements a version of the MIPS pipeline as described by the fourth chapter of the book _"Patterson & Hennessy, Computer Organization and Design – The Hardware/software Interface"_.

The project was written in **VHDL** and can be simulated in tools such as **ModelSim** or **Quartus Prime**.

## Simulation
The project includes a test program "codigofinal.s" for the fibbonachi sequence already loaded into the instruction memory in order to test the processor's behavior. To run the simulation:

Compile all modules and run the simulation
Check the outputs and internal signals through the waveform.
